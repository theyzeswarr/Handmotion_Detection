Project Overview

The Hand Motion Detection Python project leverages the power of computer vision libraries such as OpenCV to detect and track hand movements in a video stream. It utilizes the concept of background subtraction and hand contour detection to identify and track the hand region. The project can be used as a starting point for various hand-related applications, including controlling computer interfaces, virtual reality interactions, and more.
